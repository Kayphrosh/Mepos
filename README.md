# MEPOS

## Overview
This is the project repository for the MEPOS app built primarily with React and Sass 


## Project Description
MEPOS is a desktop web-based online Point of Sale (POS) application designed to streamline sales operations. It includes distinct access levels for different user roles: Superadmins, Admins, Cashiers, and Customers. Each role has its own set of functionalities, ensuring efficient management and control of sales processes. The app is built using React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface, suitable for businesses looking for an online solution to handle point-of-sale transactions.

## Architecture
The MEPOS project follows a *component-based* architecture typical of React applications.
The organization suggests a clear separation of concerns, with folders designated for components, assets, styles, and possibly services or utilities. 
This structure promotes modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and scale the application. The layout also indicates a focus on organizing components by functionality or role, aligning with the app's multi-user interface design.
