# MEPOS

## Overview
This is the project repository for the MEPOS app built primarily with React and Sass 


## Project Description
MEPOS is a desktop web-based online Point of Sale (POS) application designed to streamline sales operations. It includes distinct access levels for different user roles: Superadmins, Admins, Cashiers, and Customers. Each role has its own set of functionalities, ensuring efficient management and control of sales processes. The app is built using React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface, suitable for businesses looking for an online solution to handle point-of-sale transactions.

## Design

  * `git merge upstream/main`.


## Technology Stack
* Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, and SCSS for building the user interface.

## Architecture
The MEPOS project follows a *component-based* architecture typical of React applications.
The organization suggests a clear separation of concerns, with folders designated for components, assets, styles, and possibly services or utilities. 
This structure promotes modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and scale the application. The layout also indicates a focus on organizing components by functionality or role, aligning with the app's multi-user interface design.


## Codebase
* The MEPOS project codebase consists of a structured React application that includes folders for components, assets, styles, pages, features and utilities. 
* The codebase promotes modularity, with reusable components designed to handle specific functionalities, aligning with the multi-user interface requirements of the app. This structure enhances maintainability and scalability

## Test and Deploy
## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.
## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
